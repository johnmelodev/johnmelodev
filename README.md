My name is João Melo, a Brazilian who has lived for 1 year in Portugal 🇵🇹 and +1 year in the United States 🇺🇸. Recently, I worked at Valtech as a front-end developer, creating components for the CMS Sitecore and designing websites with my web design experience. I also developed my work as a software engineer by creating Python applications for businesses in my country.

I’m also a multi-instrumentalist musician 🎤🎸🎹 and I’m passionate about all the benefits that technology can bring and solutions it can provide for life.

💻 My specialties are automation software in Python and full-stack work, mastering front-end with React JS and back-end with Node.js and Django.
🎵 I have a YouTube channel where I cover pop and rock songs and help people develop their music production skills for free.
✈️ I love to travel and get to know new places, people, and cultures.
📚 I graduated in business and since childhood, I have always used technology to create technological solutions that optimize my tasks.
